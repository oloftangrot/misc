Source code distribution for the Real Time Simulation Protocol
Jim Ledin                                       November, 2000

This distribution contains the source code for the Real Time Simulation Protocol (RTSP), Win32 executable tools for use with RTSP, and an example distributed simulation that demonstrates the use of RTSP.

Subdirectories:
RTSP (Real Time Simulation Protocol): RTSP source code and executable Win32 versions of RTSP tools. The file "RTSP Programmer's Guide.doc" contains detailed information about RTSP.

DistSim: An example RTSP distributed simulation that consists of three federates plus a separate federation controller application. See the Readme.txt file in the DistSim directory for information about building and running the distributed simulation.

DSSL (Dynamic System Simulation Library): This is a partial version of the DSSL library, which enables dynamic system simulation in C++. This library is used by the example simulation in the DistSim directory.
