/*

   These functions are examples of unsigned and signed integer division.
   The algorithms assume 32-bit integers.  The algorithms used are
   from

      Digital Computer Arithmetic, by Joseph J.F. Cavanaugh
      McGraw Hill, 1984.

   For an integer of size N, this algorithm will take N steps.  This
   makes it slower the "high-radix" division algorithms.  The algorithm
   has been written with pipelined hardware in mind and where ever
   possible, conditions are avoided in loops.  Assuming a decent
   compiler, this code should also perform well on hardware with 
   branch delay slots.

   If you compile this with Visual C++ and you keep the .c suffix
   use -Tp to default to C++.
